# capstone_projects
This repository contains my Data Science capstone projects
My three projects are DS_Twitter Scraping, DS_Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly and DS_YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL, MongoDB and Streamlit.
I have used python language to execute this projects.
To code in Python language, I used VSCode editor and in that perticularly used Jyupiter notebook extension.
Other than this I also used MongoDB and MySQL.
